Appssus is a frontend web application that combines two main functionalities: a Keep (notes) app and a Mail app. It provides users with the ability to create, manage, and organize notes as well as send emails, all within a single platform.

# Keep (Notes) App

- Create Notes: Users can create notes containing text, images, videos, or checklists to organize their thoughts and tasks.

- Edit and Delete Notes: Notes can be easily edited or deleted to keep information up-to-date.

- Organize Notes: Users can organize their notes using colors, or pin their notes for easy retrieval.

- Search Functionality: The app includes a search feature to quickly find specific notes based on content.

# Mail App

- Send and Receive Emails: Users can compose, send, and then view sent emails through "sent" folder.

- Inbox Management: The app provides tools to organize incoming emails into folders, mark emails as read or unread, and manage attachments.

- Filters: Emails can be filtered based on criteria such as sender or subject for better organization.
